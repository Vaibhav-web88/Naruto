        <p><strong><em>Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather.</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>Personality:-Naruto is generally a very simple minded, easy going, cheerful person. He often rushes things, and misses obvious things such as Hinata's constant shyness around him. In the beginning of the series, Naruto is very fun loving, often pulling pranks on fellow villagers.</em></strong></p></td>
